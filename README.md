# SQL Music Sales Analysis (Chinook DB)

This project analyzes music sales data from the Chinook sample database using **SQL** and presents key business insights in an **Excel dashboard**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The goal was to answer real-world business questions using SQL queries, including:

- Who are the top-spending customers?
- Which countries generate the most revenue?
- What are the top music genres and artists by revenue?
- How diverse are customer genre preferences?
- Which customers purchased tracks from all "Rock" genre?

The results were exported and visualized in Excel using bar charts, pie charts, and pivot tables.
